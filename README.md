## 👋 Hi, I’m Alex, AKA @AlexMannDesigns

***"Let's build a better world together"***

- Dynamic, ambitious programmer, with a strong background in finance. I have a passion for building technologies that will make the world a better place, and help people to become better versions of themselves.

- My programming education focused on C and Unix systems. My big projects were the shell programs linked below 👀 I'm currently learning Python 🐍

- Having graduated from @Hive, Helsinki, I'm now working as a Jr. Test Engineer at [Oura](http://ouraring.com/), based in Oulu, Finland.

- Also, I do web development! You can find some of my projects here on github, check out my codepen for front-end things: (www.codepen.io/kalimarrr)

## 42sh 👨‍💻 

This was my final project at Hive, and was a big milestone. The aim was to implement the most stable and complete Unix shell possible. We used bash as our reference and adhered closely to the POSIX standard.

- The technology involved included C, Docker, Bash, Git and Linux.
- I worked in a team with one other programmer.
- The shell handles pipes, redirections, shell variables and job control.
- Areas of focus included lexical analysis and designing and building complex data structures.
- As well as my coding capabilities, I also strengthened my project planning, communication, teamwork and leadership skills.
