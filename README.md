- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex, AKA @AlexMannDesigns

- I’m interested in C/C++ and Unix systems - I recently built my own versions of the libc function printf, and the unix program 'ls'! I'm currently building my very own shell program. See my pinned projects below...👀

- Having graduated from @Hive, Helsinki, I'm now looking for opportunities in software engineering. Please get in touch if you think I'd be a good fit!

- Also, I do web development! You can find some of my projects here on github, check out my codepen for front-end things: (www.codepen.io/kalimarrr)
